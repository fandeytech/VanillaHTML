# VanillaHTML

VanillaHTML is a CSS file that enhances the look of default html when written semantically correct. There is no JavaScript and no CSS classes.

There are CSS variables that allow for some simple theming, however most websites built in VanillaHTML will look the same (like this one), so it's not recommended you use this in production applications, but to help you get to a MVP (Minimal Viable Product) without worrying about the design or classnames.
This is intended to be an educational resource to help people build more accessible websites.

You can also use this to prototype your projects super quickly. You don't need to write a single line of CSS or add any Classnames, just write Semantic HTML and VanillaHTML will do the rest.

## Note About Safari
This file uses a few properties that are not available in Safari and will not work properlly in Safari. Please use Chrome or Firefox for best results.

You can also remove the CSS Layer from the file and it will mostly work in Safari, but there are still some style issues.
