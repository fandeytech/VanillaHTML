# VanillaHTML

VanillaHTML is a CSS file that enhances the look of default html when written semantically correct. There is no JavaScript and no CSS classes.

There are CSS variables that allow for some simple theming, however most websites built in VanillaHTML will look the same (like this one), so it's not recommended you use this in production applications, but to help you get to a MVP (Minimal Viable Product) without worrying about the design or classnames.
This is intended to be an educational resource to help people build more accessible websites.

You can also use this to prototype your projects super quickly. You don't need to write a single line of CSS or add any Classnames, just write Semantic HTML and VanillaHTML will do the rest.

## Important Notes
1. There are 3 CSS files included. A css reset, VanillaHTML css, and a global css file for custom styles.
2. VanillaHTML is contained in a css layer so overwriting styles is incredibly easy.
