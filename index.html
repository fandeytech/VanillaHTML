            VanillaHTML is a CSS File that <em>enforces</em> semantically written
            HTML. The intended use is to educate beginners on how to properly
            structure a website while allowing seasoned developers to quickly
            prototype ideas. There is <b>NO JavaScript</b> and
            <b>NO CSS classes</b>.
          </p>
          <p>
            There are CSS variables that allow for some simple theming, however
            most websites built in VanillaHTML will look the same (like this one),
            so it's not recommended you use this in production applications, but to
            help you get to a <abbr title="Minimum Viable Product">MVP</abbr>
            (Minimal Viable Product) without worrying about the design or
            classnames.

            Elements like popovers and dialogs (things that are better with
            JavaScript) will be created with web-components in the future.
            However, all basic elements are pre-styled. You can view a full list

            Semantic <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> is the
            process of structuring your markup in a way that is understandable to
            assistive technology. There are many benefits to using semantics in
            your code, including great
            <abbr title="Search Engine Optimization">SEO</abbr> benefits and
            future-proofing your website. But most importantly, you can reach
            people with disabilities that can only access a tiny portion of the
            internet, think of how many potential users you could actually be
            missing out on.
